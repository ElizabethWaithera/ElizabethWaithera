## Hello, fellow innovators! 👋

I'm **Elizabeth** (but you can call me Liz), and I'm on a mission to make AI work for everyone! 🚀

### My Story
Picture this: A curious mind meets data science meets social impact. That's me! I spend my days teaching machines to be helpful, turning complex data into "aha!" moments, and occasionally geeking out over the latest AI breakthroughs. 

🌱 **What keeps me up at night (in a good way!):**
- Building friendly AI assistants that help people access health information
- Teaching LLMs to be better conversation partners
- Using data to tell stories 
- Finding new ways to make tech more inclusive and impactful

💫 **Some cool stuff I've built:**
- A heart-warming SRHR chatbot that's helped thousands access health info
- An AI buddy that helps track climate-health patterns
- Smart tools that make M&E feel less like homework and more like discovery

🛠️ **My favorite tech toys:**
- LLMs (because who doesn't love a good conversation?)
- RAG systems (teaching AI to be a better researcher)
- Python (my trusted sidekick)
- All things data science (the more complex, the better!)

🌍 **When I'm not coding:**
- Spreading the data science love as a Zindi & WiDS Ambassador
- Spinning my way through life (literally - on a bike!)
- Learning something new (always!)

### Let's Create Magic Together! ✨

Remember: The best code is the one that makes someone's life better! 🌟

*P.S. Yes, I really do get excited about vector databases. No, I won't apologize for it! 😄*
